# 2. (List of List) Write a program that allows 3 players to guess the total of 3 dice values. 
# The program first gets the playerâ€™s names, and randomly selects one player to guess first. 
# This is followed by the next player in order of the input of names. 
# The first person to guess the value wins. 
# The program then prompts whether the players wish to play again. 
# If the players do not wish to play, the the game ends. 
# Display the names of players with the most correct guesses.

# function get name

#function to randomly choose player and prompt to ask value
#show result
#if all wrong repeat until first person get it right
#prompt if user wants to play again if no game end
 
#show users with the most correct guesses 
#randit returns random int from rangeofnumbers in ()
#choice returns item in a list,tuple
